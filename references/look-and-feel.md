# Look and feel

Two design languages, each with one job:

- **Fluent 2** for product scenes.  This is where "that looks like Microsoft" comes from.  Tredence builds on
  Microsoft Copilot, Copilot Studio, Microsoft Fabric and Power BI, so the products look exactly like the real ones.
- **The Tredence 2026 frame** for the cover, an optional chapter break, a scene that names the tension or shows the
  business from above, and the close.  This is where the story and the ask live.  → `tredence-frame.md`

The two never mix: no Poppins, Bright Orange or Tredence logos inside a product, and no Fluent chrome, Copilot
gradient or product UI on a frame scene.

All sizes are CSS px on the 1920 × 1080 stage.  Product scenes use `class="scene zoom"`, which lays the UI out at
1536 × 864 and shows it at 125%, the way a laptop shows it, readable from the back of a room.

**Product facts, last checked.**  Products change.  If you know something newer, the product wins: draw what's
true and note the change in `brief.md`.

| Facts | Source | Last checked |
|---|---|---|

## Fluent 2 product scenes

**Type** (Segoe UI): caption 12/16, body 14/20, body-large 16/22, subtitle 20/28 semibold, title 24–32 semibold.
Weights 400 and 600 only.  Sentence case for everything, including buttons and headers.

**Colour.**  Neutrals do most of the work: page `--bg3` #f5f5f5, surfaces `--bg1` white, text `--fg1` #242424,
secondary `--fg3` #616161, strokes `--stroke2` #e0e0e0.  Brand blue `--brand` #0f6cbd only for the primary button,
selection, links and the active tab.  Teams uses `--teams` #5b5fc7 in the same places.  Status colours (success,
warning, danger) only for status chips and messages, never to fill bars or shapes.

**Data colours** (bars, lines, shapes in a figure outside Power BI: in a document the agent drafts, or a view you
design).  Use the palette of the product the figure lives in: in Word, Excel or PowerPoint, the Office theme
(`--office-1` #156082, `--office-2` #e97132, `--office-3` #196b24, `--office-4` #0f9ed5, `--office-5` #a02b93,
`--office-6` #4ea72e, in that order); in Power BI and the views you design, Power BI's (`.pbi` defaults).  Make the
point with one colour, not many: the value that matters in the first accent, the ones it's compared with in light
grey (`--data-muted` #d9d9d9), a limit or target as a thin dark grey dashed line (`--data-ref` #595959) labelled in
the same grey.  If a value breaks a limit, say so in words beside it; at most it gets the second accent.  Never red
for bad and green for good (traffic lights): it reads as an alarm, and colour-blind viewers can't tell them apart.
Never the agent's gradient or `.ai-touched` inside a document: the whole draft is Copilot's, and Word doesn't
draw one.

**Shape and depth.**  Radius 4 for controls, 8 for cards; the Copilot app uses the same Fluent 2 shapes (8 for
Copilot's message cards, the activity card, the prompt and the prompt starters; 12 for the person's message, with a
4 px corner by the edge it comes from) and Segoe UI throughout, with no serif greeting.  Shadows are soft
(`--sh2`, `--sh4`); only toasts and dialogs float (`--sh28`).

**Density.**  Real apps are dense and calm: lists of 3–6 items, 32 px controls, 8–16 px gaps.  Fill the shell the
way the product does (folder pane, list, reading pane) instead of leaving big empty areas.  If a pane would be
empty, add realistic secondary content (older mail, timeline items) or remove the pane.

**Icons.**  `<i class="ic" data-icon="mail"></i>` (20 px; `s16`, `s24`, `s28`, `s32`, `s48` for other sizes).
The kit has 103 Fluent System Icons; `icons.js` lists them.  Need another?  Add it to the prototype's own copy of
`kit/icons.js` from github.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons (20 px regular SVG path) and note it in `brief.md`.

**People.**  `<span class="avatar" data-name="Adele Vance"></span>` gives initials and a stable colour.  Sizes
`xs sm md lg xl`; `org` for a square company/team avatar; add `<i class="pres"></i>` (`away`, `busy`) for presence.

### Where the agent shows up

Microsoft positions the Copilot app as where employees' work starts: Home (Chat, and Cowork for multi-step work),
and Autopilot for agents that keep working on their own.  Prototypes respect that, without a fixed route.

- **Employees meet Copilot in the Copilot app** by default, with business data coming to them there (Work IQ,
  Dynamics 365, the customer's own systems), with sources.  No Copilot sidebar in Outlook or Teams (the checker
  flags it).  In Dynamics 365, its own Copilot side pane (`d365-home`, `.d3-cp`) may appear when the story's work
  really happens inside Dynamics 365, for example a seller working a record; Harrison's decision, 2026-10-26.
- **The story opens where the work starts.**  That may be Copilot Home, or the trigger itself: an alert on a phone
  in the field, an email arriving, a live Teams meeting, a record in the customer's own app, or the customer's own
  customer on a website talking to the company's agent (built in Copilot Studio).  Pick what's true for this work.
- **Other apps appear when the story needs them**: where the work begins, people reached (Teams, Outlook), or
  proof in a system of record (often in Copilot's browser pane).  Business apps come to the person; the person
  doesn't tour the apps.  No Code-mode scenes for business audiences.
- **Their way of working, if that's the point**: the customer's own Cowork skill (`story-and-data.md` §The
  customer's own way of working).
- **Autopilot as a teammate.**  What Microsoft has published (the 2026-09-25 announcement): Autopilot, previously
  Scout, is a digital teammate that works for one person; you give it a name, a role and a goal; it watches
  channels, follows up on threads, runs recurring work, picks a project back up days later, and reaches out to
  stakeholders for updates; it has its own identity, memory and workspace; it shows up where people already work
  (Teams, Outlook, chats, channels, documents) so people can @mention it like a colleague, with permissions,
  audit and governance; the owner sets the objective and boundaries and stays informed and in control.  So
  stories can show:
  - a colleague messaging or @mentioning someone's Autopilot in a Teams chat or channel, and it answering as
    itself (its own name and avatar, clearly working for its owner), never posing as the person;
  - the owner seeing that conversation in the Copilot app and stepping in: redirecting it, answering, or stopping
    it;
  - work it carried on overnight or across days, with the decisions it left for people;
  - anything consequential (sent outside, money, commitments) waiting for its owner's approval.
  Draw only what's published: the Autopilot overview (`shells.html` `autopilot`), its presence in Teams as a
  participant with its own name, and Teams and Outlook as they are.  Don't invent Autopilot screens, labels or
  wording beyond that, and don't copy internal or pre-release material.  It's in preview: label it.
- **Label preview features** where they appear, in the scene and in the presenter notes: Autopilot, and the
  in-app browser (rolling out; admins turn it on).  Don't show features that haven't been announced.
- Never copy Microsoft's own marketing characters or any internal or confidential material into a prototype.

### What screens mean

Pick screens from the story's beats, not from this list.  None of them is required, and most stories use only a
few.  Each kind of screen tells the room something; choose the one that says what this beat needs to say, and
switch screens only when the beat needs it.

| Screen | What it tells the room | Good for |
|---|---|---|
| Copilot Home, or a Today briefing | Work starts here; Copilot already knows what matters | An opening ask, a morning catch-up |
| The business at scale (a view you design: the whole book, a map, coverage before and after, the customer's own customers; or a Power BI page of their real data) | This isn't one faster day; the business works differently | The shift at scale, the measure that moves |
| Copilot answer with sources | It read the right things and shows where | A question answered, a gap found |
| Multi-step plan (Workspace drawer) | Multi-step work you can watch, with who acts on each step | A process run end to end |
| The customer's own skill (a trace step, Customize, the owner writing it) | It works the way *we* work, and our people decide how | A house method, a review standard, expert judgement shared with the team |
| Approval card (checks, policy reason) | A person stays in control of what matters | Money, anything sent to a customer, anything hard to undo |
| Power BI visual | The number is governed and traceable | A trend, a gap, a breakdown in data they really have |
| The record in the browser pane, or the system itself | It really happened | When the room needs to believe an action landed |
| Teams chat or meeting | People are pulled in where they already work | A hand-off, a live meeting, a team reply |
| Outlook mail or calendar | It reached someone; time was booked | A sent note, a meeting set up |
| Autopilot feed, a notification | It kept working while you were away | Watching, overnight work, a nudge |
| A phone | This happens away from a desk | Field, frontline, travel |
| The customer's own app or website | The agent meets people where they already are | End customers, line-of-business work |
| Two views side by side | Before and after, or two sides of one moment | The change itself, a hand-off between people |
| The work, before and after (a view you design: the process today and redesigned, steps gone, hand-offs collapsed, who owns what) | The work itself changed shape, not just sped up | Process redesign, a role that changed |
| A view you design (timeline, map, comparison, board) | The thing only this story has | The signature moment |

### Components you can draw

Compose these to fit each beat.  The starter holds the frame scenes as working code, and `assets/shells.html` holds
each product's chrome as an outline (every word a `[[placeholder]]`, numbers only so charts draw).  Copy the
chrome, write your own content, and design the rest for your story.  The outlines show how a product is built,
not what to put in it or in what order.

- Frame cover, with the headline's last phrase in gradient (starter, first scene)
- Copilot conversation in the Fluent agent UI: Copilot's message header, its work in an activity card (steps, a
  thinking node, a latency pill), an answer card with citations, source chips and the message footer, an approval
  card with checks and the policy reason, a suggestion pill (`shells.html` `chat`)
- Frame close: what the business could become, what it could be worth, and an ask if there is one (starter, last scene)
- The business at scale: a view you design, or a full Power BI report of their real data (`shells.html` `report`)
- Copilot Home with prompt-starter cards and a typed prompt (`shells.html` `home`)
- A Power BI answer, and the report in the browser pane (`pbi-answer`)
- A multi-step plan with its Workspace drawer (Steps, Output, References, Plugins), with an attachment, a clipped
  activity card and an input card (`cowork`)
- Cowork's Customize page, Skills tab: the customer's own skill next to the built-in ones (`customize`; only when
  the story uses the customer's own way of working, see story-and-data.md)
- Proof in the browser pane: a business app row and a Dynamics 365 record change (`proof`)
- A Teams chat with a post sent with Copilot (`teams`)
- An Autopilot agent's feed with an item that needs the person (`autopilot`)
- Outlook mail (`mail`) and calendar (`calendar`)
- A full Dynamics 365 record (`record`), Dynamics 365 home with Copilot's side pane (`d365-home`), Copilot
  drafting a Word file (`doc`), a full Power BI report (`report`), the customer's own back-office system
  (`business-app`)
- No code, design it: a phone in someone's hand, the customer's own website, two views side by side, a timeline,
  a map, a comparison, a board, a notification arriving (see *Need a view the kit doesn't have?* below)

**The Microsoft Copilot app is where employees meet Copilot.**  Most stories spend their agent moments here; the
other screens show where the work starts, people reached, and proof.  The kit draws it as a Fluent 2 agent UI: a
neutral frame with a NavDrawer, a lighter content layer, and Fluent 2's Copilot patterns for everything Copilot
says and does.

| Copilot app view | Root | Parts | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Window and left panel | `.cpa` (`.nav-off` hides the panel) | `.cpa-title` (`.cpa-win`), `.cpa-side` (a Fluent NavDrawer) > `.cpa-brand`, `.cpa-modes` (a TabList: Home, Code, Autopilot; `on` gets the brand underline), `.cpa-nav` (`on` gets the brand selection bar; `hdr`, `sub`, `.lbl`, `.plus`), `.cpa-me`; `.cpa-main` > `.cpa-top` (`.pick` dropdowns, `.ttl`, `.end`) | Every Copilot scene |
| Home | `.cpa-home` | `.oi.copilot.cpa-logo` (48 px mark), `.cpa-hello` (Fluent title, centred), `.cpa-sub` (one line under it), `.cpa-chips` (prompt-starter cards: an `.ic` in brand blue, a `b` title, the prompt), `.cpa-prompt` (`.ph`, `.txt`, `.tools` with `.cpa-switch` Chat/Cowork toggle buttons and `.cpa-send` with `send_filled`) | The person asks; the story's first click |
| Conversation | `.cpa-work` > `.cpa-conv` | `.cpa-chat` > `.cp-time`, `.cp-file`, `.cp-user`, `.cp-who` (Copilot's message header), `.work-box` (the activity card), `.cp-status` (latency pill), `.cp-turn` > `.cp-resp` (answer card), `.refs`, `.cp-acts` (message footer), `.chips` (suggestion pills), `.acard`; a docked `.cpa-prompt` | Copilot works, answers with sources, asks for input or approval.  Draw the work as in *Copilot's work, in Fluent* |
| Workspace drawer | `.cpa-pane.ws` (width `--pane`; about 420) beside `.cpa-conv` | `.cpa-pane-head` (drawer title, close), `.cpa-pane-body` > `.ws-sec` accordion sections (`h4` with `.end`) for Steps (`.ws-count` badge, `.steps`), Output and References (`.ws-item`), Plugins (`.ws-plug` tags) | Copilot runs a multi-step process: the plan, what it made, what it was given, what it used |
| Customize (Cowork) | `.cz` in `.cpa-main` after `.cpa-top` (`.cpa.nav-off`) | `h1`, `.cz-tabs` (a TabList: Preferences, Plugins, Skills; `on`), `.cz-bar` (`.cz-search`, `.cz-add` split button), `.cz-sec` > `h3`, `p`, `.cz-row` cards (`.plug.l` or `.cz-ic` > `.oi`, a `<div>` with `.nm` and `.t-cap`, `.tgl` switch for plugins, a chevron), `.cz-more` | Where the customer's own skills live, next to the built-in ones.  Skills tab lists: "Your skills", "Built-in".  Plugins tab lists: "Installed" (with toggles), "Discover"; button "Upload plugin".  The lists follow Learn's description; the look is Fluent 2.  A skill's own page and the Skill Report aren't pictured on Learn: don't draw them as product screens |
| Browser pane | `.cpa-pane` with `.cpa-url` (back, refresh, `.addr` pill: globe, the site, a clear ✕; `.end` expand and close) and `.cpa-page` | Put a `.lob`, `.m365.d3` or `.pbi-app` shell inside `.cpa-page`, without its left nav.  Use `.nav-off` and `--pane:1000px`.  The pane is a full-height split (from the conversation's header row to the window's edges, with a divider), as are document panes; the kit lays it out.  No tab strip: the address pill shows where it is.  While Copilot drives it: `.cp-browsing` (frame and "Copilot is browsing" tab) and `.cp-cursor` (`style="left:…;top:…"`, "Copilot is working") in the page, the prompt's `.ph` "Working on it. What's next?" and `.cpa-send.stop`; hide them all (`data-hide`) when it's done | Proof: the system of record that changed, without leaving Copilot; Copilot doing the work in a site when the doing is the point.  A preview feature: label it in the notes |
| Document pane | `.cpa-pane` with `.cpa-pane-head` (`.oi.word`, `.oi.excel`, `.oi.powerpoint` file mark, `.doc-name`, then `.end` with `.doc-acts` round comment / edit / share buttons, `.btn.primary` "Open in Word", more, close), `.doc-tabs` (File, Home `on`, Insert, Layout, References, Review, View, Help) and `.cpa-doc` > `.page` | Copilot drafts a Word, Excel or PowerPoint file next to the chat.  The page uses Word's default styles: `h1` Title (large, regular, black), `p.sub` subtitle, `h2` Heading 1 and `h3` Heading 2 (regular, dark blue), `ol` / `ul` with nested `ol` lettered.  Not bold blue titles |
| Autopilot | `.cpa-over` | `.ap-hello` (`.ap-av` + `.cpa-hello`), `.cpa-prompt`, `.feed` > `.feed-head`, a `<div>` per day with `.feed-day` and `.feed-item` (`.t`, `.dot`, text, `.det`; `need`) | An agent with its own identity keeps working and comes back when it needs the person.  Preview: show a "Preview" badge |

Supporting screens: use one when the story needs it, never with a Copilot pane inside.

| Shell | Root | Parts | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Teams | `.tm` | `.tm-bar` (search "Search or ask Copilot", `.tm-org`, `.cpa-win`), `.tm-rail` (icon-only; `on`, `.badge`), `.tm-list` > `.tm-list-head`, `.tm-pills`, `.tm-sec` (Favorites, Chats), `.tm-item` (20 px avatar and name; `sel`, `unread`, `.n` count), `.tm-main` > `.tm-head` (avatar, name, tabs Chat / Shared / Notes, `.end` icons), `.tm-chat` (centred column) > `.tm-date`, `.tm-msg` (`me` right in lavender; others grey with avatar), `.tm-compose` (`.tools` icon row) | People reached where they work: a plan posted for the person, the team replying, a colleague messaging someone's Autopilot |
| Outlook (web) | `.m365.ol` | `.m365-bar`, `.app-rail`, `.ol-ribbon`, `.ol-folders`, `.ol-list` > `.ol-mail` (`unread`, `sel`), `.ol-read` | A message that reached someone, or a reply coming back |
| Outlook calendar | `.m365.ol` with `.cal-main` | `.cal-side` (`.sw` swatches), `.cal` > `.cal-bar`, `.cal-days` (`.today`), `.cal-grid` > `.cal-h`, `.ev` (`c2`–`c5`, `ai`) | Proof that a meeting was booked.  Grid starts 8 AM; `grid-row: (hour − 8) × 2 + 1`; column 2 = Monday.  Events under an hour: title only |
| Dynamics 365 (model-driven, new look) | `.m365.d3` | `.d3-bar` (waffle, app name, bordered `.search`, `.tools` new / settings / help / notifications, `.d3-copilot` button, avatar), `.d3-nav` (`.menu`, Home, Recent and Pinned with `.chev`, `.hdr` groups, rows, `.area` switcher at the bottom), `.d3-page` (floating panel) > `.d3-cmd`, `.d3-head`, `.bpf`, `.d3-content` > `.section`; or `.d3-page.home` > `.d3-home-head`, `.d3-dash` > `.d3-card` (`.hd` with `.all` "View all", `.bd` with rows, `.d3-kpis` or `.empty`); `.d3-cp` Copilot side pane (`.d3-cp-head`, `.d3-cp-sub`, `.d3-cp-body` with greeting, `.sug`, `.cp-user`, `.cp-turn`; `.d3-cp-prompt`) and `.d3-rail`; `.d3-copilot.on` while it's open | The record or the seller's home is the point and the browser pane is too small; Copilot's side pane only when the work happens inside Dynamics 365 |
| Business app (customer's own system) | `.lob` | `.lob-bar` (`.glyph`, `.name`, `.search`), `.lob-body` > `.lob-nav`, `.lob-page` > `.lob-head`, `.section`, `table.grid` (`tr.new`) | A system that isn't Microsoft's (orders, contracts, claims, core banking), reached through a connector |
| Adaptive Card | `.acard` | `.acard-head`, `.acard-body` > `.item`, `.acard-foot` | Anything a person acts on: in Copilot, Teams or Outlook |
| Windows notification | `.toast` | `.t-app` | Background work finished |

Building blocks for any shell: `.btn` (`primary`, `subtle`, `icon`, `sm`, `lg`), `.input`, `.search`, `.tabs`,
`.badge` (`brand success warning danger solid count`), `.tag`, `.card`, `.field`, `.kv`, `table.grid` (`compact`),
`.timeline` > `.tl-item`, `.kpi`, `.progress`, `.spinner`, `.check`/`.radio` (`on`), `.chips` > `.chip`,
`.seg` (toggle group such as "Mine / Reassign"; `on` marks the choice), and `.diff` (a before → after value:
`<span class="diff"><span class="old">11/27/2026</span><i class="ic" data-icon="arrow_right"></i><span class="new">12/11/2026</span></span>`).

Agent-action blocks: `.steps` > `.step` (see `engine.md` §Process steps), `.mode` badges, `.run` (steps beside the
card being acted on), `.opt` (a choice row; `on` marks it), `.checks` (pre-checks; `li.warn` for a flag), `.policy`
(why this needs a person) and `.log` (activity: time, actor, what happened, mode badge; `.by` for a second line).

**Microsoft product icons.**  The kit carries the official icons.  Put one on an empty `<span>`: `.oi` (20 px app or
file mark: Copilot sources, chips, pane heads) or `.fav` (16 px browser-tab favicon), plus the product key:
`copilot cstudio automate dataverse d365 sales ado fabric powerbi onelake lakehouse teams outlook word excel
powerpoint sharepoint onedrive loop`.  Markup: `<span class="ref"><span class="oi teams"></span>[chat name] ·
Teams</span>`.  Rules (Microsoft's icon terms): only for the Microsoft product it belongs to; never cropped,
stretched, rotated or recoloured; the product name nearby.  Product headers (Outlook, Teams, Dynamics 365) show the
app name, as the real ones do, not an icon.  Customer and third-party systems get no icon (see below).

### Power BI: how numbers are shown

Data the customer would really have, shown as a chart, comes from Power BI, wherever it appears.  Projections and
"with agents" scenarios aren't report data: a real report wouldn't hold them, so inside one they read as measured.
Show them in a view you design or on a frame scene, labelled "Illustrative".  A figure inside a document the
agent drafts (a client letter, a memo) is drawn as that document would draw it, in the Office theme's colours
(§Fluent 2 product scenes, "Data colours").  In Copilot: Copilot finds the report, queries
its semantic model, answers in a line or two, shows the visual under the answer and cites the report (a `.ref`
with the `.oi.powerbi` icon); "Open in Power BI" opens the report in Copilot's browser pane.  See `shells.html`
`pbi-answer`; `report` there is the full screen version.  A visual can also sit on a Teams card or a
view you design, still titled and cited to its report.

| Part | Markup | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Chart visual | `figure.pbi[data-chart]` with `figcaption.pbi-head` (`b` title, `span` subtitle) | Syntax in `engine.md` §Power BI visuals |
| Card | `.pbi.card` > `.l` label, `.v` value (`data-count` to count up), `.r` reference line (`b`, `.up`, `.down`) | 3–4 in a row |
| Table | `.pbi` > `.pbi-head` + `table` (`th.n`/`td.n` for numbers, `tr.tot` total, `.up`/`.down`) | No gridlines, as Power BI |
| Slicer | `.pbi-slicer` > `b` + `span` | Top of the page |
| Report in the service | `.pbi-app` > `.pbi-bar` (`.crumb`), `.pbi-act`, `.pbi-main` > `.pbi-canvas` > `.pbi-page` (12-column grid; `grid-column:span n`), `.pbi-filters`; pages as `.pbi-tabs` (browser pane) or `.pbi-pages` (full screen) | Fill the page; check nothing runs off the bottom |

Fluent 2 base theme (Power BI's default base theme): data colours in order `#118DFF #12239E #E66C37 #6B007B
#E044A7 #744EC2`, titles and subtitles on, axis titles off, smooth lines, light gridlines, rounded visuals on a grey
canvas.  The kit applies all of this; don't restyle visuals.  Waterfalls use blue up, orange down, navy total.
Every number in the answer, the visual and the report agrees with the data sheet.

**Need a view the kit doesn't have?**  Build it in the prototype's `<style>` block from the same tokens and
building blocks.  For a Microsoft product (SharePoint, Excel, Teams on a phone), match the real product's layout:
top bar height 48, left navigation, command bar, content on `--bg3` with white surfaces.  For a phone, draw a
plain device outline (no maker's branding) around an app at phone scale, with large touch targets; put it beside
other content rather than alone on a big empty stage.  For a website the customer's own customers use, give the
fictitious company a simple, believable site (its name, one brand colour, plain navigation) with the agent as a
chat panel or card on it.  For the signature moment, design what explains it best (a timeline, a comparison, a
map, a board) with Fluent type, neutrals and one agent accent.  A line-of-business app built on Power Apps should
reuse `.d3`; the customer's own back-office system uses `.lob`.

**Customer and third-party systems.**  Never imitate a real non-Microsoft product (its name, logo, colours or
layout): no fake Salesforce, SAP, Aladdin, Bloomberg, Epic.  Show it as `.lob` with a plain functional name
("Order management", "Contract management"), and say the agent reached it through a connector.  The `.lob` bar
colour can change (`style="--lob:#..."`) but stays neutral.

### Who acts: done for you, needs input, needs approval

When the agent carries out a process, every step says who acts, with one of three `.mode` badges.  This governs
what the agent does when the story has it act; it doesn't mean a story needs an approval step or a proof scene.

| Badge | Use for | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `.mode.auto` *Done for you* | Internal, low-risk, reversible, or already agreed | Calendar holds, reminders, logging an activity in the CRM, pulling data, drafting |
| `.mode.input` *Needs your input* | A judgement only the person can make | Which discount, which option, what the client said |
| `.mode.approval` *Needs your approval* | Money, trades, orders, binding commitments, anything sent to a customer, anything hard to undo | Place an order, send a quote, move funds, change a policy |

- Never show an approval-class action as *Done for you*, even if a customer asks for "full automation".  Show the
  approval, and make it fast.
- Every approval card shows what will happen (`.kv`), the pre-checks the agent ran (`.checks`, with at least one
  honest flag when there is one), the policy reason (`.policy`), and Approve / Edit / Decline.
- When the room needs to believe it happened, show where it landed: the `.log`, or the change in the system of
  record, often in Copilot's browser pane (a `tr.new` row in the business app, a `.diff` on the record, an `.ev.ai`
  event in the calendar), or the reply, the customer's own screen, whatever this story has.  "It says it did it"
  is weaker than "there it is".

### The agent's look

- In the Copilot app, each Copilot reply opens under its message header (`.cp-who`: the Copilot mark, "Copilot",
  the time), as in Fluent 2's Copilot message.  Elsewhere (logs, records, cards),
  the agent's mark is the gradient sparkle: `<span class="cp-mark"><i class="ic grad" data-icon="sparkle_filled"></i></span>`.
  An Autopilot agent gets the `.ap-av` avatar.  Give an agent a plain job name (what it does, then "agent").  No
  mascot, no robot, no Microsoft marketing characters.
- When Copilot acts as the person (a Teams post, a sent mail), show it as the person's own message with a small
  "Sent with Copilot" caption, not as a bot.
- Copilot's agent interactions use the kit's Fluent 2 agent UI: see *Copilot's work, in Fluent* below.
- `.ai-touched` puts the gradient border on the one thing the agent created or changed; `.ai-flag` says so in
  words ("Added by [agent name]").  One per scene.  On a list row (`.tl-item`, `.acard .item`, `.log` row) it
  adds its own side padding and keeps all four edges, even as the first row; don't add inline padding.  Inside a
  rounded container that clips (`overflow:hidden`), the engine rounds the highlight's corners to match wherever
  it sits in one of the container's corners, so the ring isn't cut; don't override its `border-radius`.  The check
  flags a highlight that spills outside a clipping container.
- Answers are short, specific, and cite sources (`.cite` numbers, `.ref` chips).

### Copilot's work, in Fluent

The agent's side of the demo is drawn as a Fluent 2 agent UI: Fluent 2's Copilot patterns (a message header with
the Copilot mark, message cards, an activity card, Fluent cards for input and approval, a drawer for the plan),
built from Fluent 2 tokens.  It deliberately doesn't imitate Cowork's own look: no serif greeting, no black round
send button, no avatar-less plain-text replies, no flat grey Workspace panel.  One consistent shape keeps every
prototype calm and credible, so the **shape** below is fixed, and **every word** comes from your story: a different
customer, person and task each time.  The markup is in `assets/shells.html` `chat` (conversation) and `cowork`
(attachment, clipped activity card, Workspace drawer).

**In the conversation, top to bottom:**

| Part | Markup | How it looks and behaves |
|---|---|---|
| Time divider (optional) | `.cp-time` | Small grey relative time ("1 min ago") between hairlines |
| Attachment (optional) | `.cp-file` > `.oi` file mark, `.nm`, `.t-cap` | A white Fluent card above the person's message, right-aligned: the file they gave Copilot and its type |
| The person's message | `.cp-user` | A brand-tinted bubble on the right |
| Message header | `.cp-who` > `.oi.copilot` + "Copilot" + `.t-cap` (the time) | Opens every Copilot reply: at the start of the chat and after each message from the person.  Give it the same `data-beat` and `data-auto` as the first thing Copilot shows.  The check flags a reply without one |
| Activity card | `.work-box` > `.sum` > `.on-run` ("Working on it"), `.on-done` (`.n` + " complete"), chevron | A white card.  While it works: a brand spinner, "Working on it" and a thin indeterminate progress bar along the top edge; once every item is shown and done the engine swaps in a filled brand check and "9 items complete" (it counts and fills `.n`).  Keep the words |
| Step | `.work > li` (`data-beat`, `data-auto`) | A brand spinner, then a filled brand check; a hairline joins each item to the next.  Brand blue, never green |
| Customer's skill (optional) | `li.skill` > `.plug` (`--plug` colour, a white `.ic` glyph) + "Reviewed custom skill <b>name</b>" | Copilot loading the customer's own skill: the skill's icon in place of the check, the name in bold.  Usually early in the trace.  Only when the story uses it (story-and-data.md) |
| Thinking | `li.think` > `.lbl` (`.on-run`, `.on-done`, `chevron_right`) + `.thought` (`data-type="words"`, one `<p>` per paragraph); `open` shows it | A lightbulb.  "Thinking…" shimmers while the reasoning streams, then reads "Thought process".  The reasoning sits in a quoted panel (a brand rule on its left).  Clicking the label opens or closes it |
| Show more | `.work-box.clip` + `<button class="more">Show more</button>` | Only the latest items stay in view (`--clip`, default 136 px), faded at the top.  While a thought streams, the window ends at the newest words and the earlier steps scroll up under the fade (the engine does this).  "Show more" appears as the card's footer once something is really hidden; clicking it shows everything |
| Latency pill | `.cp-status` > `.oi.copilot` + `.t` | A small white pill under the card: the Copilot mark and one shimmering line.  Swap the `.t` on later beats as the work moves on; hide the pill (`data-hide`) when the answer starts |
| Answer card | `.cp-turn` > `.cp-resp`, `.refs`, `.cp-acts` | A white card with the answer and `.cite` numbers, the source chips under it, then the message footer: copy, like and dislike buttons and "AI-generated content may be incorrect" |
| Input and approval | `.acard` (see *Who acts*) | Fluent cards in the flow of the conversation |
| Suggestion (optional) | `.chips` > `.chip` | A rounded brand-outlined pill: the next thing the presenter clicks |

A long conversation behaves like a real one: the oldest messages scroll up under the fade at the top; nothing
gets squashed.  Plan the stops so what matters is in view.

**Write them in Copilot's voice** (forms, not content):

- **Steps**: an -ing verb, the specific thing from the data sheet, and where it comes from.  Sentence case, no full
  stop, about seven words.  Real counts and names, never "Processing data".
- **Thinking**: first person, present tense, two to four short paragraphs.  It weighs the story's real options or
  sources against each other using their names and numbers, notices the one thing that doesn't add up, and ends
  with what it will do next, including why that part needs the person.  This is where the audience sees judgement,
  so put the story's tension here.  Never a recap of the steps, marketing, or "As an AI".
- **Latency pill**: a few casual words in the present progressive, about what it's doing right now.
- **The customer's skill**, if the story has one: "Reviewed custom skill" and its kebab-case name, exactly.  Then
  let the work show it: a step or the thinking applies one of its rules by name ("[their rule], so …").
- As many steps and thinking nodes as the work really has; use `.clip` when the trace gets long.

Pacing: give a thinking node a `data-auto` of at least the previous step's run time (default 1100 ms), so each item
finishes before the next appears.  The engine keeps "Thinking…" until the reasoning has streamed.  A thought without
`open` costs no time; its text is there when someone opens it.

**The Workspace drawer** is a Fluent 2 inline drawer at the right edge: a white panel with a "Workspace" title and
a close button, then accordion sections divided by hairlines.  Each is a `.ws-sec` whose `h4` holds the title and
an `.end` (a chevron, plus any buttons):

| Section | Markup | What goes in it |
|---|---|---|
| Steps | `h4` with an empty `.ws-count` (a brand badge; the engine fills in "done / total"); `.steps` > `li.step` > `.st` > `.st-t` | The plan: three to seven -ing steps as plain lines that may wrap.  An outline circle while queued, a brand spinner while running, a filled brand check when done; while waiting for the person, a brand ring and a brand-tinted row.  No mode badges or detail lines here; the input and approval cards in the conversation carry the mode |
| Output | `.ws-item` > a file mark (`.oi`, or `.ic` `globe` for a web page) + `<div>` with `.nm` and `.t-cap` | What Copilot made, revealed on the beat it makes it, with "Updated" and a date underneath.  For a long file name, cut the middle yourself and keep the extension |
| References | `.ws-item` rows; a `folder_open` button in the `h4` | What the person gave it: the attachment, a linked file |
| Plugins | `.ws-plugs` > `.ws-plug` tags (a `.plug` tile for the customer's own skill or plugin, or the product's `.oi` for a built-in one) | The plugins or skills it used, by plain name |

**A customer's skill or plugin icon** is a `.plug` tile: a colour that suits the customer (`style="--plug:#…"`) and
one white kit glyph that says what the skill is about.  Use the same tile everywhere the skill appears (trace,
Workspace, Customize).  Never a Microsoft product logo, and never the customer's real logo.

Draw it in the kit's light theme, and never mix themes.  The Copilot mark in the message header and the latency
pill is the official colour icon; don't recolour it.  Restyle these parts in a prototype's `<style>` only to fit
its story, never back towards Cowork's look.

## Tredence frame scenes

`class="scene frame td-cover|td-content|td-section|td-divider|td-ask|td-closing"`.  The kit draws the Tredence 2026
template's chrome; you place Poppins text and flat Tredence-palette shapes absolutely on top.  Layouts, zones, the
type scale, the palette, contrast, logos, photos and components: `tredence-frame.md`.  Outlines: `assets/frames.html`.

**Readable on a photo.**  Only the cover title, its subtitle, the ask's one line and the ask pill sit on a photo,
over the Charcoal `.td-shade`.  Everything else goes on a white content scene.  The check measures the contrast
behind every line of text on a frame scene and flags anything under 4.5:1 (3:1 for text 24 px and up, or 18.66 px
bold), and flags any colour, font, gradient or shadow that isn't Tredence's.

If the story uses a frame, keep it short and let it carry the business idea (`story-and-data.md` §Start with the business shift):

- **The cover** names the change for the business, in the customer's words: the tension they live with, or what
  becomes possible.  Not a product tagline ("insights and actions in one place", "your AI assistant for X"), and
  not a list of what the demo will show.
- **The close** says how the business could work (from → to), what it could be worth (rounded, labelled
  "Illustrative", basis in the notes), and makes an ask only if the meeting needs one.  Never a recap of the scenes, a checklist against the
  brief or the customer's notes, or a list of features.  If the close would still make sense with "What you saw"
  above it, rewrite it.

Shape both for this story (one from → to, the measure before and after, the first move and the ask); neither has
to be numbered cards.  The product scenes are the proof.

## AI tells and what to do instead

| AI tell | Do this instead |
|---|---|
| Gradient hero sections, glassmorphism, neon glows, blobs | Product chrome on neutral surfaces; the gradient only on the agent |
| Giant stat counters; rocket, brain or sparkle icons everywhere | Numbers in Power BI or the record, at product size; icons only where the product would put them |
| Traffic-light figures (red bar for bad, green for good), a rainbow of bar colours, the agent's gradient ring inside a document | The product's palette (Office theme in documents, Power BI's elsewhere): one accent for the value that matters, light grey for the rest, a dark grey dashed line for a limit, and the verdict in words (§Data colours) |
| Emoji or mixed icon styles | Fluent icons only, 20 px, `currentColor` |
| A grid of identical feature cards | The real place the work happens (the Copilot conversation, the record) |
| Big unlabelled claims ("Save 10 hours a week!", "99.9%") | The business measure, rounded and labelled "Illustrative", with its basis in the notes; record data specific and from the data sheet |
| "Acme", "John Doe", "Lorem ipsum", "Task 1" | Microsoft fictitious companies and demo personas, specific tasks |
| Marketing words: unlock, seamless, leverage, supercharge, revolutionise, empower, game-changing | Plain verbs that say what happens |
| The agent knows everything instantly | Visible steps, sources, a gap it admits, a person who confirms |
| The agent's work as a checklist of green ticks you styled yourself, a Workspace you invented, or a copy of Cowork's look (serif greeting, black round send button, avatar-less plain-text replies, flat grey panel) | The kit's Fluent 2 agent UI (§Copilot's work, in Fluent) |
| The customer's skill in every demo, or a skill that only shows up as a badge | Only when doing it *their* way is the point; then the work visibly follows one of its rules, and a named person owns it |
| Thinking that narrates the steps ("Now I will read the file") | Reasoning with the story's names and numbers, the thing that doesn't add up, and what it will do next |
| Everything centred and floating | Product grid alignment: left-aligned, edge-to-edge panes |
| Inter/Poppins/system-rounded fonts | Segoe UI in product, Segoe Sans Display in the frame |
| Dark mode "AI dashboard" | Light theme product UI, as customers see it at work |
| Every prototype in the same scene order, the agent moment always a chat answer, or the same parts every time (an approval, a proof scene, a leader's report) | Screens chosen for this story's beats, and only the parts this story needs; a view designed for the signature moment |
| One person's task done faster, or the same business covering more, and nothing more | The business reimagined: what it can be now, visible in the story, with the measure that moves |
| A close that recaps the demo or ticks off the brief ("What you saw", "in one place", "single pane of glass") | What the business could become and what it could be worth (illustrative); an ask only if the meeting needs one |

## Motion

Motion explains, it doesn't decorate: things arrive when the agent produces them.  Default beat transition is a
short rise-in; `.fade`, `.slide-r` (toasts), `.pop` (cards) are alternatives.  The engine makes every change
graceful on its own (content glides, exits fade, panes push in, answers stream word by word, scenes crossfade);
see `engine.md` §Motion.  Typing is for the user's prompt or the agent's streamed answer only.  Let the agent's
work feel deliberate rather than instant, and give each moment the time the story needs.  The engine sets a
reading floor for every beat and plays the demo itself when the presenter presses Space (`engine.md` §Presenter
controls); `data-hold` gives the moment that matters more time.
